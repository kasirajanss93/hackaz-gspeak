# hackaz-gspeak

This application was presented for #HackArizona 2017, held at University of Arizona, Tuscon from 13th to 15th of January 2017.

We have developed an application to recognize gestures, translate them to text and use this text to be voiced over by alexa, as a mechanism to help those with disablity speaking to communicate better.
